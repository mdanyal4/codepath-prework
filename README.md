## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

    Example App: LinkedIn
              1. Being able to filter alumni from your university at different companies to reach out to them.
              2. Being able to showcase all accomplishments, since resumes/CVs cannot fit everything.

    Example App: Snapchat
              1. Messages disappear within 24 hours.
              2. Notifies users if someone takes a screenshot.

    Example App: Instagram
              1. Change chat backgrounds and create custom ones with AI.
              2. Post stories only for close friends.
                
    App Idea: StudyShell
        StudyShell is an app designed specifically for students at The University of Maryland. It allows users to create a profile using   
        their university email address. After creating an account, users can enter the courses they are taking in the current semester and 
        the app matches them with ther students taking the same course. Users can then reach out to them for group studying and 
        collaboration.

        So far, I’ve implemented the Registration Page, Email Verification, Login Page, and Password Reset Flow. However, there’s still a 
        lot of work to be done to make this a fully functional and polished app. I’m excited to be part of the iOS 101 course because I 
        believe it will give me the hands-on skills and structure I need to push this project forward and build better apps in the future.

        Features I would like to implement:
              1. Course-Based Matching – Users can search for study partners based on the courses they are enrolled in.
              2. Group Chat Integration – Allow users to form study groups with a built-in chat.
              3. Event Scheduling – Let users schedule and manage study sessions.
              4. Notes Sharing – Users can upload and share class notes.
              5. Performance Tracking – Optional academic progress tracking feature.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I didn't encounter any major challenges as the instructions were straightforward.
